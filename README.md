Algorithm for optimal guessing in quordle for various strategies

To use, download .exe, quordleGuesses.txt and quordleSolutions.txt to same folder.  Double click to start program. Follow instructions.  For the first option, choice 2 "MinAvg" will likely work more efficiently than choice 1 and for the 2nd option, choice 1 "Least Total Possible Solutions" will work better than choice 2. 

Program will supply guesses and then ask you to put result of the guess in in a numeric form with no spaces. For example, if your guess lumps comes back yellow, grey, grey, green, grey, enter 10020 with no spaces and press return.

Be careful once you have eliminated words as the program will not ask you to put in values for a word once eliminated by an earlier guess.
